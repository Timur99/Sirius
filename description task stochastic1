1.10 Practical problems
1. Using the algorithm (Section 1.4.1) simulate a path of the Wiener process.
Number of end-points of the grid including T is N = 100, length of the
interval [0, T] in time units is 1, time increment is ∆ = T /N. Plot the
path.
2. Using the algorithm (Section 1.4.2) simulate three paths of the Wiener
process as the limit of a random walk (n = 10, 100, 1000). Plot the paths
in one figure, add legends.
3. Using the the Karhunen-Loeve expansion (Section 1.4.3) simulate three
paths of the Wiener process with n = 10, 50, 100 terms. Plot the paths in
one figure, add legends.
4. Plot a trajectory of the geometric Brownian motion (Section 1.4.4) obtained from the simulation of the path of the Wiener process, σ = 0.5
(volatility), and r = 1 (interest rate).
5. Plot a trajectory of the the Brownian bridge (Section 1.4.5) starting at x
at time 0 and terminating its run at y = −1 at time T obtained from the
simulation of the path of the Wiener process.
6. Perform code review, write own functions, add text cells using markdown
for mathematical equations.
